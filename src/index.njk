  <p class="section-title">Who We Are</p>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>Woven Web is a community research lab. We are fostering connected cultures, developing systems in support of life, and nurturing the intersection of education, arts, and technology.</p>
    <p>We are perhaps easiest to understand through our relationships — through the organizations and initiatives we are in collaboration with, and through the work we are doing together. We are rooted in Boulder, Colorado and woven into something larger.</p>
    <p>The name says something true about our orientation: not <em>weaving</em> web, but <em>woven</em> web — recognizing the state of already being woven. The connections are already here. Our work is learning to see them, tend them, and build on them.</p>

      <h3>Spirit of the Front Range</h3>
      <p>A newly forming 501(c)(3) focused on fostering a more connected bioregional network across the Front Range. We are closely partnered in building the infrastructure of belonging for this region.</p>

    <article class="relationship">
      <h3>Regen Hub</h3>
      <p>A co-working and venture cooperative in downtown Boulder where much of our work lives and breathes. The Hub is a node — a place where builders, thinkers, and community weavers find each other.</p>

      <h3>techne.institute</h3>
      <p>An integral technology institute we are helping to birth — bringing together AI, contemplative practice, and applied learning. Techne asks what it means to develop human capability alongside technological capability.</p>

      <h3>ATLAS Institute & Naropa University</h3>
      <p>We are in deep connection with CU Boulder's ATLAS Institute and with Naropa University — two institutions working at the intersection of technology, arts, and integral learning. Their proximity is not coincidental; we are working to foster the culture that can emerge between them.</p>

      <h3>Open Civics</h3>
      <p>Working on improving civic processes and protocols — building the open infrastructure that healthy governance requires. We share a belief that civic participation needs better tools and better culture.</p>
